UICollectionViewDragAndDropDemo
===============================
The sample app is a single view application containing two vertically stacked UICollectionView subviews.  The bottom UICollectionView contains cells which the user can drag to the upper UICollectionView.  In addition the app does some validation such as preventing users from dragging cells in the same UICollectionView.  When this happens the dragged card appears faded indicating an invalid operation.
